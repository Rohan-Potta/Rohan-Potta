# Hi, I'm Rohan Potta! Welcome to my GitHub Page ðŸ‘‹  

- Iâ€™m passionate about automationâ€”whether itâ€™s setting up an on-premise Kubernetes cluster using Ansible or using Python packages like BeautifulSoup to build ML datasets.  
- My interests span from Machine Learning to DevOps, including Docker, Kubernetes, and CI/CD pipelines.  
- Beyond tech, I enjoy listening to music, watching anime and TV shows, and discussing all things tech and entertainment.  
- Feel free to reach out if youâ€™d like to chat about any of these topics or just say hi!
